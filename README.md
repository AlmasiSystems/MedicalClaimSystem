# MedicalClaimSystem
A medical claim system for Human Resource to track with ease.

This is my second project that I have done during my intership.

This system is called Medical Claim System which is a system to replace the company's traditional way to track down medical claim by using
Microsoft Excel. I develop this system to help the Human Resource department to track down staff's medical claim.

The system has a CRUD features where admin can register new staff, add staff's claim, delete staff record, update record, view staff's
summary on medical claim record on a specific year. The system has a feature that can find staff easily but typing in anything that
is related to the staff such as name, ID number, phone number, department or their family name.

MCS used several javascript plugin such as the DataTables.net for table interfaces that can export to PDF, Excel or CSV by a click of 
a button and localhost sendmail.exe to send a reminder by email to the staffs that has medical claim less than RM100. This system uses
a little bit of JOIN TABLE for MySQL because it has to join medical claim amount by ID number which is the primary key.

Feel free to explore my codes and you have my consent to use my code. Cheers!
